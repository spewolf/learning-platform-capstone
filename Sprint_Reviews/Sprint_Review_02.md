# What went well?   
* Tyler    
    * Everyone was able to get a lot done.  I think for the most part, we've gotten more done than I thought we would have.  So, I think we're a little ahead of schedule.
* David   
    * Made a lot of progress with theme colors and mockups.
    * I feel more comfortable with Material UI.
* Spencer   
    * Website is looking polished
    * everyone learned a lot

# What didn't go so well?   
* Tyler    
    * There may be some issues with the database still.  But we will takle those as we go and work them in with the other sprint objectives.
* David  
    * Having some minor issues having a uniform theme.
    * I still have some pages that need a layout (though these should be relatively easy to implement)
* Spencer   
    * I wasn't able to get around to getting custom user information on the sign in

# What have I learned?   
* Tyler      
    * I learned more about Firestore security rules and how to access Firestore from JS.
* David   
    * How to check for an answer locally (i.e., within a single file)
    * How to turn components that weren't originally Buttons into interactable objects.
* Spencer   
    * I Learned a lot about styling in react
    * I learned how to get components split up

# What still puzzles me?   
* Tyler   
    * I haven't done a lot of thinking about how exactly we might implement the actual quizes so we'll need to discuss that a bit further.
* David   
    * Passing information (specifically questions/answers/solutions) between files
* Spencer   
    * Still not sure how the database for the users will work

# What will we change to improve?   
* Tyler   
    * I always like to encourage as much communication as possible within the project.  I think we're doing pretty well with that so far, though.
* David   
    * I'm going to encapsulate my work as much as I can now that I'm getting the hang of Material so it is more reusable and easier for everyone to work with.
* Spencer   
    * I am going to set up more consistent times to work on the project
