# What went well?   

* Tyler   
    * I was able to get all of my work done and we are now ahead of schedule.
* David   
    * The site looks a lot better than it used to.
* Spencer   
    * I got all of my work done and it looks good!
    
# What didn't go so well?   

* Tyler    
    * I changed how I was doing the diagrams for the learning module, so that was about an hour or so wasted, but worth it in the end.
* David  
    * I had to do a lot of my work last minute because of a ton of assignments I suddenly had to do.
* Spencer  
    * I did some of my work last minute.

# What have I learned?   

* Tyler     
    * Don't do diagrams in html.
* David   
    * I learned more about how typography, margins, padding, and other strictly design-related things work in React/Material UI.
* Spencer   
    * Inline code in react is really powerful

# What still puzzles me?   

* Tyler   
    * I'm still not exactly sure how Spencer is wanting to do the assignment stuff, but I'm sure he'll explain it on Wednesday.
* David   
    * I'm still not sure how some global theming things will be handled, if at all. Getting a consistent look this far into the project has been proving somewhat difficult. 
* Spencer   
    * I am feeling good. Also @Tyler an event will give you the info and you just add to database

# What will we change to improve?   

* Tyler   
    * I'm not going to do diagrams in html anymore like a dummy.
* David   
    * I'm going to think ahead more when it comes to theming and design to make sure we're all on the same page.
* Spencer   
    * I should have explained the plan more clearly which I will attempt in the future
