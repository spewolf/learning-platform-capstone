# What went well?   

* Tyler   
    * 
* David   
    * I learned how to use Storybook to simulate a mock quiz and questions
    * I have a better understanding of how props and events are passed between components in JavaScript
* Spencer   
    * I was able to pivot to supporting my teammates when my other work was blocked
    * Our team was able to solidify our quiz design this week
    
# What didn't go so well?   

* Tyler    
    * 
* David  
    * It took me a while to grasp how JavaScript handles event and prop objects passed between various components
    * A random power outage led to to corruption of some data in my Raspberry Pi (which I'm running the project off),  
    which took me some time to resolve
* Spencer  
    * We had some miscommunication about what each component needed to be doing

# What have I learned?   

* Tyler     
    * 
* David   
    * I learned how to use Storybook to simulate a mock quiz and questions
    * I have a better understanding of how props and events are passed between components in JavaScript
* Spencer   
    * I learned about communicating with a team when multiple pieces need to come together

# What still puzzles me?   

* Tyler   
    * 
* David   
    * Still not sure how to work on some aspects of the design (margins, font, size, etc.) nor when I'll do it
* Spencer   
    * I am not entirely sure yet how I will inject the question components
        * It might have to be done with the useState hook and keeping the question in state

# What will we change to improve?   

* Tyler   
    * 
* David   
    * Laying out exactly how information will be passed between components earlier on will help us all develop more cohesively
* Spencer   
    * I think that doing a bit more design upfront would be helpful to our work
