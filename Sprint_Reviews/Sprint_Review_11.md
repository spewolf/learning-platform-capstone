# What went well?   

* Tyler   
    * I was able to finish all of the main stuff and the website is now pretty much complete.
* David   
    * 
* Spencer   
    * I was able to get everything done and it works great
    
# What didn't go so well?   

* Tyler    
    * I had to rewrite some old code with the learning module to make it easier to add onto in the future.
* David  
    * 
* Spencer  
    * Got a late start again

# What have I learned?   

* Tyler     
    * I learned how to use Material UI's tables.
* David   
    * 
* Spencer   
    * I learned loads about how to validate react forms

# What still puzzles me?   

* Tyler   
    * At this point, probably just figuring out how best to prepare future teams to work on the project once we're gone.
* David   
    * 
* Spencer   
    * Not sure my pattern is the best method

# What will we change to improve?   

* Tyler   
    * We need to add a lot of documentation to the project in order to prepare future teams to work on the project once we're gone.
* David   
    * 
* Spencer   
    * The next time I do validation I am going to try a different pattern
