# What went well?   

* Tyler   
    * I was able to get more done than I expected to, especially related to the learning module because it didn't take as long as I thought to connect Spencer's component in the practice module.
* David   
    * 
* Spencer   
    * I learned a lot in this sprint!
    * We had really good teamwork connecting stuff
    
# What didn't go so well?   

* Tyler    
    * There were a few formating things that I couldn't figure out for the learning module.  But, that's something that can be fixed after all of the important stuff is done.
* David  
    * 
* Spencer  
    * I really underestimated how long my work would take
    * I didn't do enough planning before coding

# What have I learned?   

* Tyler     
    * I learned a lot about how React works, especially with piecing together multiple components.
* David   
    * 
* Spencer   
    * I learned about how to create controlled forms
    * I learned about lifting state

# What still puzzles me?   

* Tyler   
    * I'm still pretty new to web dev in general so as far as formatting and making sure everything looks how I want it to look is still tricky and takes a bit of time.
* David   
    * 
* Spencer   
    * Not sure how we want to implement the results so I temporarily am having
      it show score

# What will we change to improve?   

* Tyler   
    * I think I will try to do a little more research on various layout/formatting things.
* David   
    * 
* Spencer   
    * I am going to start looking up design patterns before doing a complex
      functionality
