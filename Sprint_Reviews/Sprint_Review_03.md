# What went well?   

* Tyler   
    * I feel like I learned a lot about front-end React development this week.
* David   
    * Learned more about how React passes information between files
* Spencer   
    * Tyler made a change for me early on that simplified our authentication
    * I was able to get my primary objective done
    
# What didn't go so well?   

* Tyler    
    * I accidentally assigned one of the issues to the wrong person so that issue never got done.
* David  
    * Busy week and illness had me fall behind where I wanted to be
* Spencer  
    * David fell victim to illness after failing his con saving throw
    * I didn't have time to work on a secondary objective after my primary

# What have I learned?   

* Tyler     
    * A lot about front-end development and a clearer view of the project going forward.
* David   
    * How basic text information is sent between files (specifically to a parent)
* Spencer   
    * I got some experience working with the database
    * I learned how to modify the authentication process

# What still puzzles me?   

* Tyler   
    * We're still having some issues regarding how each part of the website is going to connect but I feel like we'll be able to figure that out as we go.
* David   
    * How to have the parent handle the inputs of information input to a child class
* Spencer   
    * I am not sure how to take care of validation in registration which
        will likely become a goal after finishing base functionality

# What will we change to improve?   

* Tyler   
    * I need to be more careful when assigning issues and planning out the sprints.
* David   
    * Start sooner and get work in other classes out of the way so I can focus more time onto this
* Spencer   
    * As I mentioned last week I should start working earlier in the week
