# What went well?   
* Tyler   
We were able to communicate well and everyone was able to get their work done.   

* David   
    * We did a really good job of communicating when organizing roles and planning.
    * We've done a good job of sharing resources and knowledge as needed.

* Spencer   
    * We all were really successful getting work done on the design.
    * Our communication was great for splitting up the tasks.

# What didn't go so well?   
* Tyler   
Outlining exactly what needed to get done at the beginning of the week was a bit tricky.   

* David   
    * Scheduling work was difficult this time around (some for personal reasons, some out of our control).
    * Learning as much as I can about web development in such a short time has been rough.

* Spencer   
    * I need to distribute my time more evenly across the week.
    * David was a bit stuck on the layout design and I could have reached out to support him.

# What have I learned?   
* Tyler   
I learned a lot about how Firestore stores data and how to keep that data secure.  I also learned a 
lot of cool features with GitLab that I didn't know about before like time tracking.   

* David   
    * I've learned much about UI features in web development, specifically in React using Material design.
    * I feel more confident about comprehending others' JavaScript code syntax and structure.

* Spencer   
    * I learned how to do firebase authentication!
    * I learned how to redirect the users based on their auth status.

# What still puzzles me?   
* Tyler   
Since most of my time was spent looking at database and backend stuff, I'm still not sure about how 
exactly React works.  So that is something I'll need to catch up on in the coming weeks.   

* David   
    * I don't really know much about how React handles GUI interactions.
    * Understanding how different files interact within JavaScript is confusing right now.

* Spencer   
    * I am not sure what the process will be for recording signup data like name.
    * I need to figure out how to conditionally render the format buttons.

# What will we change to improve?   
* Tyler   
I think doing a little bit more research before creating and assigning issues could help refine 
exactly what our plans will be for the upcoming sprint.   

* David   
    * Reaching out for help more often when it is needed.
    * Managing time better.
    * Either sticking closer to the project plan or revising a few sprint goals.

* Spencer   
    * I think that we could do a mid sprint standup to check in on everyone.
