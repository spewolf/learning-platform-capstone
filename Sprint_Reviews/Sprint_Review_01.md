# What didn't go so well?   
* Tyler   
Outlining exactly what needed to get done at the beginning of the week was a bit tricky.

# What have I learned?   
* Tyler   
I learned a lot about how Firestore stores data and how to keep that data secure.  I also learned a 
lot of cool features with GitLab that I didn't know about before like time tracking.

# What still puzzles me?   
* Tyler   
Since most of my time was spent looking at database and backend stuff, I'm still not sure about how 
exactly React works.  So that is something I'll need to catch up on in the coming weeks.

# What will we change to improve?   
* Tyler   
I think doing a little bit more research before creating and assigning issues could help refine 
exactly what our plans will be for the upcoming sprint.
