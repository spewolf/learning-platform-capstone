# What went well?   

* Tyler   
    * I feel like our objectives going into this week were better prepared.
* David   
    * I'm pleased with the progress we made this week. Everything is really coming together well. Also, I got to clean up some of the older files we don't need any more.
* Spencer   
    * We took some time to prep for the coming modules
    
# What didn't go so well?   

* Tyler    
    * Personally, I would have liked to have managed my time a little better and get things done sooner.
* David  
    * I'd like to have had time to better prepare the dashboards being connected to assignments / assessments.
* Spencer  
    * I didn't realize that tylers changes would conflict with my code which led to bugs

# What have I learned?   

* Tyler     
    * I learned how to use query strings with React!
* David   
    * I learned how to show different content to different users based on an attribute of their account.
* Spencer   
    * I learned all about firebase rules!

# What still puzzles me?   

* Tyler   
    * I think everything is starting to get tied together, so not a lot puzzles me.  If anything, I would say database implementation, but that shouldn't be too difficult.
* David   
    * Off-hand, I still don't know much about how assignment / assessment / statistics modules will get linked with the dashboard, but I'm not worried about it.
* Spencer   
    * I am not sure what the best way is to display assignments for a student

# What will we change to improve?   

* Tyler   
    * I think communicating what needs to be done first.  Ideally, I think we would have done backend database stuff a week or two ago to get set up for this week.  But, we're still ahead of schedule, so not worried about it.
* David   
    * Occasionally, I need to think ahead more when programming. Even now, I find myself putting in placeholders a little too often when I should be more focused on dynamic implementations.
* Spencer   
    * I will need to be more proactive with how other changes will affect my code
