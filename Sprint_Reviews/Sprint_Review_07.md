# What still puzzles me?   

* Tyler   
    * I think everything is starting to get tied together, so not a lot puzzles me.  If anything, I would say database implementation, but that shouldn't be too difficult.

# What will we change to improve?   

* Tyler   
    * I think communicating what needs to be done first.  Ideally, I think we would have done backend database stuff a week or two ago to get set up for this week.  But, we're still ahead of schedule, so not worried about it.
