# What didn't go so well?

    * 
* Spencer   
    * We should do less on weeks with holidays

# What still puzzles me?   

* Tyler   
    * We're gonna look at firebase rules again to see what's up with those, but we should be able to fix it.  And there are work-arounds if we can't.
* David   
    * 
* Spencer   
    * Not sure why my firebase rules were broken
