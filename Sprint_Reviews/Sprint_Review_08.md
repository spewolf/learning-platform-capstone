# What went well?   

* Tyler   
    * I felt like I was more productive than usual and I think the assessment module looks pretty good.
    * Everything is coming together really well.
* David   
    * I feel things are going to look really good soon.
* Spencer   
    * I learned a lot of new stuff this week
    
# What didn't go so well?   

* Tyler    
    * There were some issues with the database that I'm not sure if we've 100% fixed yet.  But we have work arounds, worst case.
* David  
    * I didn't get all I wanted done, and got stuck somewhere I didn't expect to.
* Spencer  
    * Did not have enough time to complete my tasks

# What have I learned?   

* Tyler     
    * I learned a lot about async functions, date-time formating, and advanced javadoc
* David   
    * I learned more about how JS handles local variables and some more about Material.
* Spencer   
    * We should do less on weeks with holidays

# What still puzzles me?   

* Tyler   
    * We're gonna look at firebase rules again to see what's up with those, but we should be able to fix it.  And there are work-arounds if we can't.
* David   
    * Still don't know how most of the database stuff works.
* Spencer   
    * Not sure why my firebase rules were broken

# What will we change to improve?   

* Tyler   
    * I would have liked to have gotten my stuff done sooner but I had a pretty busy weekend.
* David   
    * I need to focus more on the project, it's just been difficult with other assignments recently.
* Spencer   
    * I should reach out when learning a new thing if someone else knows more
