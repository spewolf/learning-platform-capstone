* David  
    * 
* Spencer  
    * I didn't get anything done early

# What have I learned?

* David   
    * 
* Spencer   
    * I learned a lot about resetting passwords in firebase

# What still puzzles me?   

* Tyler   
    * We need to work on a way to view all submission data.  Not sure if this will be a seperate page or be on the dashboard.  But we'll figure that out on Wednesday.
* David   
    * 
* Spencer   
    * Not sure how to handle errors well in react forms

# What will we change to improve?   

* Tyler   
    * I think I could have done a little bit more research into all the different options for graphs.  But the one I chose ended up working well.
* David   
    * 
* Spencer   
    * I might do some research on error handling and fit it into the last sprint
