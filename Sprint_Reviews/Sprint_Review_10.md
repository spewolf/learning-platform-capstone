# What went well?   

* Tyler   
    * I was able to get a lot of work done on the statistics page and I think it looks really nice.
* David   
    * I found some problems that would be difficult to fix later on, so I'm glad I caught them now.
* Spencer   
    * I was able to get a lot done in this sprint
    
# What didn't go so well?   

* Tyler    
    * I had some trouble with a shallow copy of states when doing the statistics page accordion logic.  But I figured it out.
* David  
    * I had trouble linking the instructor dashboard up with the database.
* Spencer  
    * I didn't get anything done early

# What have I learned?   

* Tyler     
    * I learned a little more about how state works in React as well as how to create graphs using react-vis.
* David   
    * I learned about how react handles events.
* Spencer   
    * I learned a lot about resetting passwords in firebase

# What still puzzles me?   

* Tyler   
    * We need to work on a way to view all submission data.  Not sure if this will be a seperate page or be on the dashboard.  But we'll figure that out on Wednesday.
* David   
    * I'm still not sure what exactly is going wrong with my getting information from the database, or if it's necessary for me to do so. 
* Spencer   
    * Not sure how to handle errors well in react forms

# What will we change to improve?   

* Tyler   
    * I think I could have done a little bit more research into all the different options for graphs.  But the one I chose ended up working well.
* David   
    * I need to try to communicate my issues earlier.
* Spencer   
    * I might do some research on error handling and fit it into the last sprint
